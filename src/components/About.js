      <p>
        Hi! I’m Joemarie A. Tomona Jr., a Computer Science student at Pamantasan ng Cabuyao.  
        When I’m not busy with schoolwork, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes, watching shows, or playing mobile games.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve always been fascinated by software development, and my goal is to become a skilled web developer.  
        I love the idea of building things that can make life easier for people and leave a positive impact.  
      </p>
    </div>
